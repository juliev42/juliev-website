## Build agents like teams

Agentic systems are seductive: schedule the lab draw, draft the note, flag the anomaly. But automation only scales if accountability scales with it. I prototype agents like I design teams — with clear ownership, observability, and a bias toward escalating early when the stakes are human.

## Keep loops legible

My favorite loops are tight and legible. An agent ingests a wearable stream, summarizes overnight changes, and proposes an action plan. A clinician or coach reviews the plan with context I don't want the model to hallucinate: motivation, money, mental load. The agent learns from that feedback, not just the data.

## Invite humans back in

The most agentic workflow is the one that invites the right human back into the loop at the right time. That's the difference between convenience theater and durable health impact.
