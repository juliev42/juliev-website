I keep a sensor taped to my arm
because I like proof that feeling is data.
I hum along to the graphs,
watch the curve quiet when I breathe deep.

In the hallway light, I remember: algorithms are just agreements.
We promise to listen, to adjust,
to leave space for the part of me
that is not yet measured but very much alive.
