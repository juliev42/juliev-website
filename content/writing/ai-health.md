## Context that listens

I keep returning to the question of how much context a model needs to truly help a patient. The answer is always: more than we currently feed it, but not more than a clinician already holds in their head. Between those poles is the real work — encoding what makes care humane without stripping it of nuance.

When we build copilots for rare-disease clinicians, we anchor them to longitudinal data: phenotypes, labs, lived experience. Retrieval pipelines matter, but so do consent patterns and human review. The agent that can surface a phenotype in seconds is also the agent that must defer when uncertainty spikes.

## Guardrails with heart

The design constraints are not just accuracy. They're trust, time, and tone. A good system is transparent about what it knows, graceful about what it doesn't, and generous with pointers to the next best action.
